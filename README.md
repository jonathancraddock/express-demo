# express-demo
(following an express tutorial)

## Notes

Install NodeJS.

In VSCode, clone the repo into a working folder.

* Ctrl+Shift+P for command palette
* `git: clone`
* I'm using this (currently empty) repo `https://github.com/jonathancraddock/express-demo`
* Point at projects folder
* Clone and add to workspace

Terminal, in folder. Init to initialise the project, creating `package.json`.
```dos
npm init -y
```

Then install express:
```dos
npm i express
```
